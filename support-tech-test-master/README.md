# Tech Test for the Sauce Labs Support team
Clone this repo and go through each file in the test directory. This relies on NPM & Node all tests should run after an `npm install`. Use `npm run` to list all possible commands.
## Objective
Complete all tasks in `test/bonus.js`, `test/brokenSauce.js`, and `test/workingSauce.js`. It may be easiest to do them in this order:

1. brokenSauce
2. workingSauce
3. bonus

Bonus objectives are just that, bonuses, and should only be completed if you have time.

Hint: If you can't find your tests on app.saucelabs.com double-check you're in the correct datacenter.
